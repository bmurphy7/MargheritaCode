MargheritaCode
==============

Code repository for operating, analyzing, and running measurements on the Margherita setup (all for RPi)



Git Instructions
==============

To be clean about what kind of user is committing to the repository,
go to http://github.com and setup an account. E-mail
ejangelico@ucdavis.com with your account (or don't...) .

Then do:
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
git config --global user.name "your name"

These commands will put a tag on your name for each commit so we know
who did what.


Simple Commits:
git add [filenames]    //this adds any modified files or adds new files that have not yet been created
git commit -m 'your message here, telling what your commit did'
git push origin master   // the final push, use your github account
